# 2. Simple PostGis Queries  
In this part of the turorial we will lean how to do simple queries in geospatial database.
Prerequsites are database with PostGis extension and imported OpenStreet map data (Part 1. of this tutorial).
## 2.1 Spatial reference systems
We need a lot of math to transform three dimensional space to two dimensions and there are many of ways of doing it. In this subchapter, we will look into why and how to do it.
#### Projections
Earth is three dimensional object, but maps are two dimensional rectangles (unless you are really making 3D model of Earth, like Google maps when you are zoomed out). We use different types of projections for calculating where point on Earth should be drawn on 2D map. These projections have to make some sacrifice of precision to be able to transfer sphere to rectangle. Each projection can keep some parameters real but distort others. For example most commonly used Mercator projection keeps angles between two points, meaning when you measure angle and follow it with compass you will reach your destination. But in doing so it distorts distances, and this distortion is bigger the closer we get to the poles. In fact, poles are projected at infinity so usually maps cut out at -85° south and 85° north.

#### Shape of the Earth
Earth is non-perfect sphere, or spheroid. Because of centrifugal force of Earth's rotation, poles are flattened relative to radius of Equator. This causes difference in radius of approximately 21km between poles and Equator. If projection does not take this into the account, accuracy will be reduced the closer you get to the poles. It is not a big concern though, because poles are unhabitated and a loss of precision is of little consequence for most map users.
#### SRID
SRID (Spatial reference identifier) is unique number assigned to a specific projection. As I mentioned in Projections part of this tutorial, projections have their tradeoffs in how they display and distort reality. You need to choose the right one, but unless your use case is really specific mercator projections are the best, because that is projection type that most people are used to. Also all major map APIs are using mercator, but they can still differ. For example Google Maps, or MapBox (with which we will work in this tutorial) use coordinate systems with ranges -180° to 180° in west-east direction and -90° to 90° in south-north direction, but Open Street map use WSG 84 system (same as GPS units) which is three dimensional system with 0 coordinates in center of Earth. Thanks to that, it carries information about distance from center of the Earth, which can be used to calculate height relative to sea level in addition to position. It does not have maximum values because it can be used for coordinates in space.
#### SRID Implications
Different spatial reference systems have different coordinates for the same place on Earth. It can vary really widely, for example MapBox Coordinates for Bratislava are around 47°/17°, but in WSG 84 system coordinates are in ten thousands range. Mixing data with different SRIDs will work. Math still works, but you will get incorrect results, often out of bounds of the map. When you want to display something on map with base layers such as roads, rivers, buildings etc., you need to use SRID which is used by the map API, otherwise your data will not match locations on map tiles.  
So, the takeaway is **you need to be careful to not mix different SRIDs and final result from queries must be in the same SRID as your map API uses.**

## 2.2 Data processing
If you import additional data with osm2pgsql tool, it will replace your existing tables imported by this tool. So it is good idea to move data you care about to your own table. In addition, it is often the case that data you get are not in the SRID you need. There are two solutions to this problem. One is to write your queries with function calls ([ST_Transform](https://postgis.net/docs/ST_Transform.html)), but this makes queries more complex to read and to execute as well. In this case, computation that transforms coordinates to different SRID need to run every time the query runs. Second approach is to create new column in PostGis database with SRID you need, or replace original column alltogether if you don't need original SRID.
#### Data preparation
Data we imported from OpenStreet map contain a lot of data, but we will use only small part of it for our queries to make them more practical. In table planet_osm_roads are all major lines you can find on map, such as administrative borders, waterways, highways, major roads etc. In this example we will work with data related to railway network. Table has many columns, but most of them have [null] value. That means geometry is in no way related to column type. Railway related line will have [null] in aeroway column for example. If there is non-null value, it specifies further what the geometry represents. For example railway can have narrow_gauge, rail subway value to name a few. There is very long list of all possible tag values [here](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Map_features).  

We will start with query that will selecting the columns we want. Note that there are more columns that we will use that can have additional information about the rail, full list is [here](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Map_features) in section Railway. We will use osm_id, name, railway, tunnel, and way. We will filter it based on railway column, because we care only about railway related geometries. Any non-null value is valid.
~~~~sql
SELECT osm_id, name, railway, tunnel, way
FROM planet_osm_roads
WHERE railway <> 'null';
~~~~
This will return list of geometries. Now we can store result of this query to our new railway table:
~~~~sql
SELECT osm_id, name, railway, tunnel, way
INTO railways
FROM planet_osm_roads
WHERE railway <> 'null';
~~~~
Now that we have copy of the data, running new osm2pgsql import won't result in loss of data and if we mess up transformation of geometry from original SRID to new one, we will have backup (not that we will in this tutorial, but you never know). Mapbox uses SRID with number 4326 (this can be found in the documentation). We can check which SRID number our geometry has at the moment by running SQL query:
~~~~sql
SELECT Find_SRID('public', 'railways', 'way');
~~~~
This will return number 3857, meaning we need to transform this column from SRID 3857 to 4326. Now we need to create new column for new SRID, because column is created with SRID number and only this SRID can be inserted into the column. After that, we can drop original column to save space, since we don't need geometry with this SRID. Later we will need electrified and usage columns as well, so let's add them now so geometry column is last because it can be quite long and it will mess up query result table.
~~~~sql
ALTER TABLE railways	ADD COLUMN electrified text;
ALTER TABLE railways	ADD COLUMN usage text;
ALTER TABLE railways	ADD COLUMN geom geometry(Geometry, 4326);
~~~~
When we have column, we can fill it by calling ST_Transform function:
~~~~sql
UPDATE railways SET geom = ST_Transform(way, 4326);
~~~~
Now we can drop original way column sice we don't need SRID 3857 geometry anymore.
~~~~sql
ALTER TABLE railways DROP COLUMN way;
~~~~

#### Adding additional data
Imported data does not contain all the tags available, since that would make datasets really large. We want information about usage of the railway and if it is electrified or not. OpenStreet map has this, but we need to do our own export. This can be done with [Overpass API](https://overpass-turbo.eu/). This API allows for filtering by the tags and coordinates to export only what we really need. Problem is, it returns the data in json format, which can not be used to import directly to database. There is heavy GIS tool for converting this geojson to .osm.pbf format used by osm2pgsql import tool, but unless you have complicated data you can write your own import. I did this in OsmJsonToPostGis console application which is part of the server solution. You need to run this console application to create new table temp_railway_data and it will contain usage and electrification information, or you can do it with this tool: [gdal](https://www.gisinternals.com/release.php).  
  
To get this data, I used this query in the Overpass API:
```
// set timeout in case our query is too large
[timeout:25];
// gather results
(
  // filter for rail only in area covered by bounding box of current map view
  way["railway"="rail"]({{bbox}});
);
// print results
out meta;
>;
out meta qt;
```
Then just simply run my console application which reads the json and inserts data to temporary table, or use gdal and then osm2pgsql tool. Beware, if you use osm2pgsql it will recreate all planet_osm tables so you will loose everything that was in them!  
Now we can update existing table with data from temporary table. Both tables have the same osm_id for the same geometry, so pairing is easy. You can update existing table but that query is slow, so its faster to create new table:
~~~~sql
SELECT railways.osm_id, railways.name, railways.railway, railways.tunnel, temp_railway_data.electrified, temp_railway_data.usage, geom
INTO slovakia_railways
FROM railways
LEFT JOIN temp_railway_data
ON railways.osm_id = temp_railway_data.osm_id;
~~~~
#### Simple query by distance
Now we can select all railways in 10km radius from Bratislava. To do this, first you need to find out coordinates of Bratislava, which are 17.107748 longitude and 48.148598 latitude. Then, we can create point with this coordinates by calling PostGis function:
~~~~sql
ST_MakePoint(17.107748, 48.148598);
~~~~
Then we can use ST_DWithin in WHERE clause which checks if two geometries are within specified distance in meters.
~~~~sql
SELECT * FROM slovakia_railways WHERE ST_DWithin(geom, ST_MakePoint(17.107748, 48.148598)::geography, 10000);
~~~~
Congratulations, you were able to filter data based on geospatial data. Of course you can add conditions on non-geospatial colums and filter other columns, for example querying only tram lines based on railway column value.

## 2.2 Summary
First rule is: **do not mix different SRIDs or you will get nonsensical results!**  
Most fequently used PostGIS functions and their purpose:
- Change SRID to desired one: [ST_Transform](https://postgis.net/docs/ST_Transform.html)
- Calculate distance: [ST_Distance](https://postgis.net/docs/ST_Distance.html)
- Check if geometries have at least one point in common: [ST_Intersects](https://postgis.net/docs/ST_Intersects.html)
- Select overlaping polygons with different overlaping rules: [ST_Overlaps](https://postgis.net/docs/ST_Overlaps.html), [ST_Contains](https://postgis.net/docs/ST_Contains.html), [ST_Within](https://postgis.net/docs/ST_Within.html)
- Create bounding box for single geometry or set of geometries: [ST_Envelope](https://postgis.net/docs/manual-1.4/ST_Envelope.html)
- Calculate length of line geometry: [ST_Length](https://postgis.net/docs/ST_Length.html)
- Calculate area of polygon: [ST_Area](https://postgis.net/docs/ST_Area.html)
- Create polygon wraping geometry with given distance from geometry: [ST_Buffer](https://postgis.net/docs/ST_Buffer.html). This can be used to select all geometries within distance of polygon.
