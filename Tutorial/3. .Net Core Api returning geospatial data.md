# 3. Using PostGis Queries in C#
In this part of the tutorial we will learn how to use PostGis queries in .NET Core web server.
Prerequsites are database with PostGis extension and imported OpenStreet map data (Part 1. of this tutorial) and .NET 6 framework. We will use Visual Studio 2022, but you can use your preffered C# editor.
## 3.1 Creating .NET application
We start with creating new project. This can be done in empty solution or added to your existing solution. We will use ASP.NET Core Web API with .NET 6 framework, but you can choose other types of projects as well as frameworks. There may be some differences in what to clean from default projects, if there is default dependency injection or not, different NuGet versions etc. The main PostGis code will be similar though.  

Start with choosing ASP.NET Core Web API in Add new project menu:

Then we will remove classes used only in sample WebApi, WeatherForecastController.cs and WeatherForecast.cs:

## 3.2 Adding connection to PostGis database
**You can checkout this commit ADD COMMIT to get clean solution to start with this step.**  

Next step is to connect to our database. To do that, we will need few NuGets. First is Npgsql and you can check [this github page](https://github.com/npgsql/npgsql) to check how to use newest version if something changed since writing this tutorial. Note that version supporting Entity Framework exists, but we will not use it in this tutorial since its use is more reliant on knowledge of Entity Framework than PostGis knowledge. Then we will need Npgsql.NetTopologySuite to get geometry supporting types. You can find the NuGets in Package manager or use console commands:
```
NuGet\Install-Package Npgsql -Version 7.0.4
NuGet\Install-Package Npgsql.NetTopologySuite -Version 7.0.4
```

Web API uses dependency injection, so we will need to register DbConnection as a service. _(If you are not using dependency injection, you can create connection directly.)_ For this, we will create new folder named "Config" and add new class named "DbConnectionConfig" into this folder. Then we create connection like this:
```cs
using Npgsql;

namespace GeospatialApi.Config
{
  public static class DbConnectionConfig
  {
    private const string ConnectionString =
      "Server=127.0.0.1;Port=5432;Database=GeoDatabase;User Id=postgres;Password=password;";

    public static IServiceCollection AddNpgSqlDataSource(this IServiceCollection services)
    {
      var dataSourceBuilder = new NpgsqlDataSourceBuilder(ConnectionString);
      dataSourceBuilder.UseNetTopologySuite();
      var dataSource = dataSourceBuilder.Build();

      services.AddSingleton(dataSource);

      return services;
    }
  }
}
```
  
Then we use this method in Program.cs to register our connection to services:
```cs
builder.Services.AddNpgSqlDataSource();
```
Then we will need to add Json configuration. This is needed for API to correctly parse geospatial query results into REST Api responses:
```cs
// Json converters for geoJson handling
builder.Services.Configure<JsonOptions>(options =>
  {
    options.SerializerOptions.DefaultIgnoreCondition = JsonIgnoreCondition.WhenWritingNull;
    options.SerializerOptions.PropertyNamingPolicy = JsonNamingPolicy.CamelCase;
    options.SerializerOptions.Converters.Add(new JsonStringEnumConverter(JsonNamingPolicy.CamelCase));
    options.SerializerOptions.NumberHandling = JsonNumberHandling.AllowNamedFloatingPointLiterals;
  }
);
```
Now all our classes can easily access our connection and use it. Add folder "DbContext" and add new class to it named "OsmContext". It is good convention to add new "context" class for each set of related queries to have separation of concerns, instead of putting all queries into one class. This controller will demonstrate different ways how to retrieve geospatial data from PostGis database. If you have some repeating methods in multiple controllers, it is a good idea to create class with this logic and inherit it in your controlers.  

Our controller will use database connection from dependency injection simply by putting it as parameter to contructor like this, and we store it to private field.
```cs
private readonly NpgsqlDataSource _dataSource;

public OsmContext(NpgsqlDataSource dataSource)
{
  _dataSource = dataSource;
}
```
Then we can add methods for each query. All will have the same overall structure:
  1. Open new connection to DB
  2. Create command with SQL we want to execute
  3. Use reader to read result to the format we want
  4. Return processed result
## 3.3 Get Api method to get all railways in range
To be able to return something from Api, we need to retrieve it from the database first. We will use DbConnection class and SQL query used in part 2 of this tutorial that returns all railways in given distance from point.
```sql
SELECT * FROM slovakia_railways WHERE ST_DWithin(geom, ST_MakePoint(17.107748, 48.148598)::geography, 10000);
```
Our method will be returning coordinates for each railway in linestring format, and there can be multiple railways in range. That means we will need to return an IEnumerable<string>. In addition, we will use Task to take advantage of threads.    
When you take a look on the query, there are clear parameters that can be adjusted to get different results. These parameters are latitude, longitude and distance from center. So these will be our parameters. So in the end, method added to DbConnection class will have this signature:
```cs
public async Task<IEnumerable<string>> GetRoadsInRange(double latitude, double longitude, double distance)
{
}
```
Then we need to open connection. NpgsqlDataSource was already injected in construtor and stored in _dataSource field. We can call CreateConnection() to create new connection. This connection will stay open until closed or disposed, so we should use using to dispose it at the end of the scope:
```cs
await using var connection = _dataSource.CreateConnection();
connection.Open();
```
After that we can create new NpgsqlCommand using text of our query with parameters:
```cs
await using var command = new NpgsqlCommand(@$"
  SELECT * 
  FROM slovakia_railways 
  WHERE ST_DWithin(geom, ST_MakePoint({Math.Round(longitude, 4)}, {Math.Round(latitude, 4)})::geography, {distance});",
  connection);
```
Then we will use ExecuteReaderAsync() in command to execute it and get reader that can be used to read results. Then we will check if the query result has column with the name we need and which index it has. If not, it means query failed and we will return empty list. You can do different error handling, but here we will take no crashing approach.
```cs
var reader = await command.ExecuteReaderAsync();
var column = (await reader.GetColumnSchemaAsync()).FirstOrDefault(c => c.ColumnName == "geom");

if (column?.ColumnOrdinal == null)
{
  return Enumerable.Empty<string>();
}
```
Then we need to repeatedly call ReadAsync() on reader. Each call will return one row from the query result and we will add it to result list. At the end of the loop we will return the list.
```cs
var result = new List<string>();
while (await reader.ReadAsync())
{
  result.Add(reader.GetFieldValue<Geometry>(column.ColumnOrdinal.Value).ToString());
}
return result.ToArray();
```
To use this in dependency injection, we need to register it in Program.cs class. You can add this to any line:
```cs
builder.Services.AddTransient<OsmContext>();
```
Now we need controller class that will contain Get method for Rest Api. We will add new folder "Controllers" and new class "OsmController". This class needs to inherit from Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ControllerBase class and use [ApiController] decorator. Another decorator [Route("api/[controller]/[action]") is needed to provide url path to this controller and its methods. All controller classes need to be registered in Program.cs. This is already done by default with "builder.Services.AddControllers();" call. This will search classes inheriting from Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.ControllerBase and Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Controller and register them. Our OsmController will need to have OsmContext injected in costructor to access Db:
```cs
namespace GeospatialApi.Controllers
{
  [ApiController]
  [Route("api/[controller]/[action]")]
  public class HeatMapController : ControllerBase
  {
    private readonly NpgsqlDataSource _dataSource;

    public HeatMapController(NpgsqlDataSource dataSource)
    {
      _dataSource = dataSource;
    }
  }
}
```
Most of the work is already done in OsmContext. Here we just need to take parameters from query and pass them to OsmContext.GetRoadsInRage. Then we return the result. Using default values for parameters is helpful to provide sample values for testing or for users trying to explore our Api via Swagger.
```cs
[HttpGet(Name = "RailroadsInRange")]
[ProducesResponseType(StatusCodes.Status200OK, Type = typeof(IEnumerable<string>))]
public async Task<IActionResult> Get(
  [FromQuery] double latitude = 48.148598,
  [FromQuery] double longitude = 17.107748,
  [FromQuery] double radiusInMeters = 10000)
{
  var context = new DbConnection(_dataSource);
  var result = await context.GetRoadsInRange(latitude, longitude, radiusInMeters);
  
  return Ok(result);
}
```
After you start the web api, Swagger will appear. There will be our single Get method. You can try to execute it. It should return list of linestrings.

## 3.3 Returning GeoJson from Api
List of LineStrings is not that useful for out Api user. Usually geojson is what is required to work with the data any further in map Api. PosGis can return data in GeoJson format for us, sparing us building GeoJson on our own. We will create second Get method that will return GeoJson and use the same parameters as method in part 3.2 of this tutorial. First, we need to modify our query. To get GeoJson, we need to call ST_AsGeoJSON method. This method takes list of columns that will be used for geojson. Geometry type column will be used to determine GeoJson geometry type, and any other columns will be put to 'properties' property. This can be used to return anything related to the geometry that is not part of the GeoJson standard, such as geometry name, id in Db or other domain specific information related to it. To get set of columns we will use nested query. This query will be the same one we used in previous part.
```sql
SELECT * FROM slovakia_railways WHERE ST_DWithin(geom, ST_MakePoint(17.107748, 48.148598)::geography, 10000);
```
Then we will wrap this in second select and use ST_AsGeoJSON.
```sql
SELECT ST_AsGeoJSON(t.*) as geojson FROM
(SELECT * FROM slovakia_railways WHERE ST_DWithin(geom, ST_MakePoint(17.107748, 48.148598)::geography, 10000)) as t
```
This will return one colum for each row that looks similar to this:
```json
{
   "type":"Feature",
   "geometry":{
      "type":"LineString",
      "coordinates":[
         [
            17.206735,
            48.1947929
         ],
         [
            17.204791,
            48.194565
         ],
         [
            17.2035626,
            48.194404
         ],
         [
            17.2026903,
            48.1942929
         ],
         [
            17.2012572,
            48.194126
         ],
         [
            17.2011389,
            48.1941139
         ]
      ]
   },
   "properties":{
      "osm_id":4259396,
      "name":null,
      "railway":"rail",
      "tunnel":null,
      "electrified":"contact_line",
      "usage":"main"
   }
}
```
This can be used directly in map Api. This should be standard way of returning geospatial data.

Now we can create second method in OsmContext that will use this modified query and another method in OsmController that will be Get method returning GeoJson format. Try this on your own to verify if you understand this part of tutorial. If you are struggling, you can check THIS COMMIT for final result.
