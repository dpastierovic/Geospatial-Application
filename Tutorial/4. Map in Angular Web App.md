# 4. Map in Angular Web App.md
In this part of the tutorial you will learn how to use MapBox Api to display map and geometries on it in Angular Web Application.
## 4.1 Angular Web Application
Since this tutorial is not focused on how to work with Angular you can either set new project and remove default component yourself, or you can use THIS COMMIT to have clean starting project for this part of the tutorial. After creating new app or checking out the commit you can run these commands to add node modules for MapBox:
```
npm install mapbox-gl --save
npm install @types/mapbox-gl --save
```
Then we will create new style for the map component. We will use styla that matches parents width and uses 900px for height. Add this style to map.component.css:
```css
.match-parent {
  width: 100%;
  height: 900px;
}
```
Then in Html we will add column that takes most of the width. Our div where map will be shown needs to have an Id for MapBox api to be able to inject map into the page. Small space left on right of the screen will be there for future buttons we will add to interact with the map:
```html
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-lg-11">
    <div id="mapContainer" class="match-parent"></div>
  </div>
</div>
```
Typescript code will be in map.component.ts. We need to create new instance of the mapboxgl.Map class. We need to do this in ngOnInit() instead of constructor. This is caused by mapboxgl.Map trying to find html tag where it should be distplayed that is not yet accessible in the constructor. We need to set few properties for our map and then store it to private field:
```js
private map: mapboxgl.Map | undefined;

constructor() {
}

ngOnInit() {
  this.map = new mapboxgl.Map({
    accessToken: environment.mapbox.accessToken,
    container: 'mapContainer',
    style: 'mapbox://styles/mapbox/streets-v11',
    zoom: 13,
    center: [17.107748, 48.148598]
  });
}
```
- accessToken is token from your MapBox account created in part 1. of this tutorial.
- container is id of html element where map will be displayed.
- style is style from [MapBox gallery](https://www.mapbox.com/gallery), or your own. You can create your own style in your account by based on existing style and tweaking which layers should be displayed and how they should look. Properties you can change are color, thickness, transparency, different look based on zoom levels and many more.
- zoom and center are coordinates and zoom level that will be used by the map when it is initialized

You can also add controls for zoom level and orientation to have alternative to mouse controls by calling:
```js
this.map.addControl(new mapboxgl.NavigationControl());
```
When you run the application you can see map taking most of your screen. You can run the application by executing this command in the terminal of Visual Studio code:
```
ng serve --proxy-config proxy.conf.json
```
Using --proxy-config is not required at this point but we will need it later for communication with .NET Core Web Api, and you need to add the config file if you want to use it at this point. We will do this in part 4. of the tutorial, so now you are fine with running ng serve only.
## 4.2 Adding point to the map
Point can be represented in multiple ways, such as circle, marker or custom image. Displaying all kinds of geometries work in the same general way. There is data source with the raw data. This contains type of the geometry such as point, polygon, feature collection etc. (part 2. of this tutorial) and coordinates of these geometries. In addition geometry can have custom properties used to display information related to the geometry on the map, such as name. Last thing source needs is an unique id. Multiple layers can use the same source of data. We can add source for point like this:
```js
this.map.on('load', () =>{
  if (this.map == undefined) return;
  
  this.map.addSource('pointSource', {
    type: 'geojson',
    data: {
      'type': 'Feature',
      'geometry': {
        'type': 'Point',
        'coordinates': [17.107748, 48.148598]
      },
      'properties': {
        'name': 'point'
      }
    }
  });
});
```
Notice that we do not call addSource directly in the ngOnInit but it is in annonymous method hooked onto 'load' event. This needs to be done because initializing map takes some time and we need to wait until it is complete or we will cause error. Then geojson with geometry data follows.  
If you run the application at this point you will not see any circle on the map. That is because we only added source, but did not add layer with information how it should look. We can do that like this:
```js
this.map.addLayer({
  id: 'pointLayer',
  type: 'circle',
  source: 'pointSource',
  paint: {
    'circle-radius': {
    'base': 5,
    'stops': [
      [1, 5]
      ]
    },
    "circle-color": '#e55e5e'
}});
```
Id is unique id for this layer. Then we define how the point should be displayed, in this case as circle. Then we link it to the source of the data with id we gave to the source in the previous step. Last thing remaining is to set paint property, where we need to set radius. You can set base radius used by default and then specific radiuses for given zoom levels in 'stops' array. Then we set color of the circle. After doing this we will see point on the map.

To demonstrate using two layers for the same source we will add marker layer for this point as well. We can do it like this:
```js
this.map.loadImage(
  'https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/assets/custom_marker.png',
  (error, image) => {
  if (error || this.map == undefined || image == undefined) {
    return;
  }

  this.map.addImage('custom-marker', image);
  this.map.addLayer({
    'id': 'markerLayer',
    'type': 'symbol',
    'source': 'pointSource',
    'layout': {
    'icon-image': 'custom-marker',
    "icon-anchor": "bottom",
    'text-field': ['get', 'name'],
    'text-font': [
    'Open Sans Semibold',
    'Arial Unicode MS Bold'
    ],
    'text-anchor': 'top'
    }
  });
  this.map.moveLayer('markerLayer', 'pointLayer')
});
```
There is quite a lot to unpack here. We are loading image from MapBox tutorial in the first few lines and adding it to the images available for displaying on the map if the loading was successful. We will use this image for our marker. Then we add layer with the marker image. Again, we need unique id in the id property. Then we specify type as symbol, which is type for custom images. Then in the layout we set loaded image as the image that should be displayed. Setting anchor to the bottom means bottom edge will be at the coordinates in vertical direction and it will be centered in horizontal direction. This is done to point tip of the marker image on the actual coordinates we want to display. Default would be center of the image. And last settings are related to the text. If you remember, our data source had custom property named 'name'. In this property we set how and where this property will be displayed. To pair name property with the text we use 'text-field' property set to ['get', 'name'] which means this should be taken from data source custom property named 'name'. Rest of the properties are related to the font and where text should be anchored. Here we set top, which means top of the text will be on the actual coordinates. This will prevent clipping into the marker image. Last line is not related to marker itself, but it reorders 'pointLayer' on top of 'markerLayer'. This is done to be able to see both, since without changing this marker would cover our circle from previous layer because it is bigger.  
Final result will look like this:

## 4.2 Adding line and polygon to the map
In this part I assume you alread understand how sources and layers work. For this reason, I will post here only properties that you need to set in sources and layers, but try to implement it yourself. If you struggle you can checkout THIS COMMIT to see working solution.  
Line coordinates:
```
[
    [17.107748, 48.148598],
    [17.107748, 48.158598],
    [17.117748, 48.158598],
    [17.137748, 48.148598]
]
```
Line properties:  
- line-color
- line-width
Polygon coordinates:
```
[[
    [17.107748, 48.148598],
    [17.107748, 48.158598],
    [17.117748, 48.158598],
    [17.117748, 48.148598],
    [17.107748, 48.148598]
]]
```
Polygon properties:
- fill-color
- fill-opacity

Final result should look similar to this (you could choose diferent colors and opacity):

After doing this you should be able to understand how layers and sources work. You can find complete list of properties you can use to customize look of the layers [here](https://docs.mapbox.com/style-spec/reference/layers/).
