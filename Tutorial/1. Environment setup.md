# 1. Environment Setup
In this part of the tutorial you will learn how to setup environment for work with geospatial data. This includes installing postgress database with postgis plugin, creating database and importing data from open street map into the database.
## 1.1 Postgres installation
Postgres is relational database with great support for spatial operations thanks to mature PostGIS plugin.
Download installer for your operating system from here:  
https://www.postgresql.org/download/  
Then run the installer. You will be able to install PostGIS extensions during stardard postgis instalation by selecting this checkbox:

Then install PgAdmin 4 from here:  
https://www.pgadmin.org/download/  
After installation run PgAdmin4. You will get popup to setup master password, which will be used to access databases.  
## 1.2 Create database

When you log in, create new database with name GeoDatabase:

After that, run command to use PostGIS extension in this database:  
```SQL
CREATE EXTENSION postgis;
```
You should see new table spatial_ref_sys with different SRIDs. Also other objects are added, such as functions and types. You can see SRIDs and verify if extension is properly used by executing:
```SQL
SELECT * FROM spatial_ref_sys;
```
## 1.3 Import OpenStreetMap data
Next step is to download OpenStreetMap data and import it into our database. For that, you will need osm2pgsql tool. You can download it here:  
https://osm2pgsql.org/doc/install.html  
After downloading tool, you will need data. You can either download pregenerated package for example from here:  
https://download.geofabrik.de/europe/slovakia.html  
or select part of map for which you need data here:  
https://www.openstreetmap.org/export#map=16/48.1495/17.0918  
Put downloaded .osm.pbf file to folder where you installed osm2pgsql tool and execute command line command:  
```
osm2pgsql -c -d GeoDatabase -U postgres -H localhost -W filename.osm.pbf
```
You will be asked for database password. After entering it, importing can take several minutes, depending on size of the dataset. After the import is completed, you will have new tables and their names start with planet_osm. You can now query the data with PostGIS geospatial functions.  
## 1.4 Tools for web application using MapBox  
In this tutorial we will create Angular web application with MapBox map for displaying various data from our database. Data will be queried from .NET Core web server. For this we will need some developer tools. You can use your preffered ones, but this tutorial will use Visual Studio Code for Angular web application and Microsoft Visual Studio for .NET Core web server. If you don't have these programs, you can download them and install from here:  
#### Visual Studio Code
Download: https://code.visualstudio.com/download  
Installation guide: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/setup-overview  

We will need a bit more installing to be able to create Angular apps:
NodeJs: https://nodejs.org/en/download
Angular: after installing NodeJs, run in Visual Studio Code console:
```
npm install -g @angular/cli
```
You can have problems running commands from Visual Studio Code console because of strict script execution policy. You can relax it by running Powershell comand:  
```
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

#### Microsoft Visual Studio
Download: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/  
Installation guide: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/install/install-visual-studio?view=vs-2022

#### MapBox
We will need MapBox account to have access to their map. Free version is enough for our needs. It has limited map tiles usage per time period, but you would be concerned by this only in production.  
Create account:  
https://account.mapbox.com/auth/signup/?route-to=%22https%3A%2F%2Faccount.mapbox.com%2F%22  
Account will ask for credit card information to prevent generating a lot of free accounts and getting around payments for enterprise applications, but you won't be charged anything unless you set up subscription plan.  
After loging in to your new account, you will see your API key and button to create new API key. We will need to use this key to be able to use map in our web application.
